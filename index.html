        <blockquote>
<p>I think I was Dutch in a past life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A harmless enough phrase in a conversation. I was, however, compelled to be a smart-ass. I wanted to say something like "Even if you go back 5000 years, you were bugs the whole way down."</p>

<p>Then I started wondering -- is that true? The biomass of bugs on Earth is gigantic but their lifespan is short. If I'm likely to be reborn as a bug, the life would end quickly and I'd have another shot at human. How much time would really need to pass between being human in different lives?</p>

<p>So this project was born. To try and math-out an answer to that question.</p>
